This repository contains code for the paper ``Gut bacterial aggregates as living gels'', by Brandon H. Schlomann and Raghuveer Parthasarathy. The code is divided into two main repositories: ``data'' and ``simulations''. The ``data'' repository contains a script for plotting the experimental size distributions from the .xlsx file included with the paper. The ``simulations'' repository contains code for the three core models studied in this paper along with an example script for each.
